# Citibike Bikesharing Analysis



## Overview

A potential business partner wanted me to analyze some data from the company Citibike, in order to help them determine 
if it seems feasible to start our own bikesharing company in Des Moines, Iowa. I used data from the month of August 2019, directly
from Citibikes website, in order to build data visualizations using Tableau to help us better estimate the ability to run a 
profitable bike sharing service in Des Moines.

Here is the link to my finished Tableau story.

## Results

This chart shows how long a bike was rented for and how many times that duration of bike rental occurred. The most popular length of 
rental was 5 hours and 15 miutes.

This chart shows how long a bike was rented for and how many times that duration of bike rental occurred base on gender. The most popular
length of rider for males was 5 hours and 46 minutes, females 6 hours and 26 minutes.

Heatmap of total trips taken each day and each hour of the day. Filtered by gender. Most popular rental times for males and females
was 8am and 5pm to 6pm

Heatmap of total trips taked each day and each hour of the day. Most popular rental times were 8am and 5pm to 6pm.

Heatmap of total trips taken based off of one time users versus subscribers per weekday filtered by gender. Male subscribers rented the
most bikes.

Looking for trends based on which weekdays are the busiest. Thursday was the busiest rental day, followed by Friday and Saturday.

Looking for rider demographic trends based off of user age groups. 30 to 39 year olds are by far the age group with the most rentals.

## Summary

To be completely honest, if I were to be analyzing data to help someone decide of the feasibility and possible profitability of
starting a bike sharing company in a new city, very little of what the challenge asked us to find would be relevant to answering that
question. The two relevant pieces of info that I did obtain was that most of the rentals seem to have occurred around the standard
United States work week.  With rentals peaking around 7am and after 5pm.  So if Des Moines is host to a plethora of office jobs in a
difficult to drive and high cost to drive area, that would be good for our business model.  Also, the age group data I collected would
be the other relevant information.  If a high percentage of Des Moines population were to fall in the age groups with the least amount
of ride shares, then projections for our business would be negative. Or we would know that we would need to develop different strategies
in order to increase ride shares with those age groups.  

Two additional visualizations I believe would be helpful would be either maintenance costs or life cycle of bicycles. This would help determine
possible expenses to be calculated into our business proposal. Also, charting dating across all 12 months would benefit in projecting revenues
based off of possible environmental factors. Could we maintain high volumes of rentals during the winter months.
